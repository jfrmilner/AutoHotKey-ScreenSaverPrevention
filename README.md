AutoHotKey-ScreenSaverPrevention
================================

An ahkscript to move the mouse one pixel to the right and then back again every minute which tricks the computer into thinking there is an active user. 
This allows for a light touch workaround to unwanted ScreenSaver starts which can be enabled or disabled by pressing Ctrl+5. 
Iâ€™ve even added a Tray Tip so its easy to tell if this is running or not.
