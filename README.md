# AutoHotKey-ScreenSaverPrevention
================================

An ahkscript to move the mouse one pixel to the right and then back again every minute which tricks the computer into thinking there is an active user. 
This allows for a light touch workaround to unwanted ScreenSaver starts which can be enabled or disabled by pressing Ctrl+5. 
Iâ€™ve even added a Tray Tip so its easy to tell if this is running or not.

## Why?
+ Prevent the screensaver while giving presentations
+ Alway look active on Skype
+ Prevent powersaving features
+ Great workaround for enforced IT Policy

## Installation
1. Download and install AutoHoyKey from here https://autohotkey.com/download/
2. Download AutoHotKey-ScreenSaverPrevention.ahk from this repository
3. Double click the ahk file to start the script
4. Press Ctrl+5 to toggle on/off Screen Saver Prevention
